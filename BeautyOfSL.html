<h1>Sigiriya</h1>
<p class="para">The Lion Rock of Sigiriya is one of the most famous highlights in Sri Lanka. The photogenic rock is over 200 meters high and is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
    On top of this rock stood the palace of King Kasyapa in the 5th century. You can still see the ruins of the palace at the top, from where you have an amazing view over
    the vast green jungle. The rock owes its name to the lion, carved in stone, which guards the stairs. Now only the legs are left. At the foot of the rock you will find
    beautifully landscaped gardens, canals, a small museum and countless monkeys roaming around. The climb up, via almost 1900 steps, is tough but well worth it. Halfway
    up you can make a stop at the well-preserved murals of undressed women and at a smoothly polished mirror wall in which the king could admire himself.</p>
<h2>Travel tips Sigiriya</h2>
<p class="para">Visit Sigiriya early in the morning when it is still cool. The climb is even harder in the afternoon heat. Although the late afternoon is a bit quieter in terms of
    visitors. From Colombo and Kandy you can also book a full day tour to Sigiriya, often including a visit to the Dambulla Cave Temples.</p>
<p class="para">Take into account crowds and a fairly hefty entrance fee of approximately $ 30.</p>

<h1>Ella</h1>
<p class="para">Discover the relaxation paradise of Sri Lanka; Ella. A village with a wonderful vibe in a beautiful green, hilly environment. Ella is known as a backpacker’s paradise,
    but is also a great destination for luxury travelers during their Sri Lanka tour. In the vicinity you will find tea plantations, waterfalls, viewpoints and the most
    beautiful hiking trails. Climb Ella Rock (about 2.5 hours of hiking) for a great view and also hike up on Little Adam’s Peak (about 1.5 hours) for even more panoramas.
    Furthermore, the Rawana Falls, the Nine Arch Bridge and some temples and tea factories are worth a visit. Moreover, Ella is known for a famous train ride! The train
    journey from Ella to Kandy (around 7 hours) goes straight through the tea plantations and is one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world.</p>

<h1>Kandy</h1>
<p class="para">Kandy is the cultural center of Sri Lanka. The city is an important place of pilgrimage for Buddhists because of the famous Temple of the Tooth (Dalada Maligawa Temple).
    Here the sacred tooth of Buddha is kept in a golden stupa. During prayer you can take a look at the room where the tooth is kept and you can sometimes see hundreds of
    Buddhists making sacrifices, including many monks. In the temple complex you will also find several museums and important Buddhist relics. But Kandy has even more to
    offer. Visit the botanical gardens, the picturesque lake in the heart of the city, the atmospheric “old quarter” and the wood and precious stone workshops where you can
    buy handmade souvenirs. In the evening you can attend a traditional dance show.</p>
